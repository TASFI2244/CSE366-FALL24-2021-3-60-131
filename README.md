This project implements a grid-based simulation featuring two AI pathfinding algorithms: A* and Uniform Cost Search (UCS). The simulation involves an agent navigating a grid to complete tasks while avoiding barriers.

Features

A* Algorithm: Uses a heuristic (Manhattan distance) to find the optimal path to the nearest task.
Uniform Cost Search (UCS): Finds the shortest path to the nearest task by considering the cost of each move.
Dynamic Task Completion: Tasks are dynamically generated, and the agent completes them by navigating around barriers.
Pygame Visualization: Visual feedback via Pygame displays the grid, tasks, barriers, and the agent's movement in real time.
